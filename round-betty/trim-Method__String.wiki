Removes the leading and trailing white space and line terminator characters from a string.

 stringObj.trim()
==Parameters==
; stringObj: Required. A String object or string literal. This string is not modified by the '''trim''' method.

==Return Value==
The original string with leading and trailing white space and line terminator characters removed.


==Remarks==
The characters that are removed include space, tab, form feed, carriage return, and line feed. See Special Characters (Windows Scripting - JScript) for a comprehensive list of white space and line terminator characters.

For an example that shows how to implement your own trim method, see Prototypes and Prototype Inheritance.


==Example==
The following example illustrates the use of the '''trim''' method.

 var message = "    abc def     \r\n  ";
 
 document.write("[" + message.trim() + "]");
 document.write("&lt;br/&gt;");
 document.write("length: " + message.trim().length);
 
 // Output:
 //  [abc def]
 //  length: 7
