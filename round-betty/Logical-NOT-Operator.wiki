Performs logical negation on an expression.

 result '''= !''' expression
==Parameters==
; result: Any variable.
; expression: Any expression.

==Remarks==
The following table illustrates how result is determined.

{| class='wikitable'
|-
! If <code>expression</code> is
! Then <code>result</code> is
|-
| True
| False
|-
| False
| True
|}
All unary operators, such as the '''!''' operator, evaluate expressions as follows:

* If applied to undefined or null expressions, a run-time error is raised.
* Objects are converted to strings.
* Strings are converted to numbers if possible. If not, a run-time error is raised.
* Boolean values are treated as numbers (0 if false, 1 if true).
The operator is applied to the resulting number.

For the '''!''' operator, if expression is nonzero, result is zero. If expression is zero, result is 1.
