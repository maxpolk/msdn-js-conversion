Provides an identifier for a statement.

 label ''':''' statements

==Parameters==
; label: Required. A unique identifier used when referring to the labeled statement.
; statements: Optional. One or more statements associated with label.

==Remarks==
Labels are used by the '''break''' and '''continue''' statements to specify the statement to which the '''break''' and '''continue''' apply.


==Example==
In the following code, the '''continue''' statement refers to the '''for''' loop that is preceded by the <code>Inner:</code> statement. When <code>j</code> is 24, the '''continue''' statement causes that '''for''' loop to go to the next iteration. The numbers 21 through 23 and 25 through 30 print on each line.

 Outer:
 for (i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i++) {
    document.write ("&lt;br /&gt;");
    document.write ("i: " + i);
    document.write (" j: ");
    
 Inner:
    for (j = 21; j &lt;= 30; j++) {
       if (j == 24)
           {
           continue Inner;
       }
       document.write (j + " ");
   }
 }
