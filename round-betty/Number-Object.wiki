An object that represents a number of any kind. All JavaScript numbers are 64-bit floating-point numbers.

 numObj = new Number( value )

==Parameters==
; numObj: Required. The variable name to which the '''Number''' object is assigned.
; value: Required. The numeric value.

==Remarks==
JavaScript creates '''Number''' objects when a variable is set to a number value, for example <code>var num = 255.336;</code>. It is seldom necessary to create '''Number''' objects explicitly.

The '''Number''' object has its own properties and methods, in addition to the properties and methods inherited from '''Object'''. Numbers are converted into strings under certain circumstances, for example when a number is added or concatenated with a string, as well as by means of the '''toString''' method. For more information, see [[javascript/Operators/Addition|Addition Operator (+)]].

JavaScript has several number constants. For a complete list, see [[javascript/Number/Number Constants|Number Constants]].
