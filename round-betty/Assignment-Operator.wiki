Assigns a value to a variable.

 result = expression

==Parameters==
; result: Any variable.
; expression: Any numeric expression.

==Remarks==
The = operator behaves like other operators, so expressions that contain it have a value. This means that you can chain assignment operators as follows: <code>j = k = l = 0</code>. In this case <code>j</code> , <code>k</code> , and <code>l</code> equal zero.
