Tests for the existence of a property in an object.

 result = property in object
==Parameters==
; result: Required. Any variable.
; property: Required. An expression that evaluates to a string expression.
; object: Required. Any object.

==Remarks==
The '''in''' operator determines whether an object has a property named property. It also determines whether the property is part of the object's prototype chain. For more information about object prototypes, see Prototypes and Prototype Inheritance.


==Example==
The following example shows how to use the '''in''' operator:

 // Create an object that has some properties.
 var myObject = new Object();
 myObject.name = "James";
 myObject.age = "22";
 myObject.phone = "555 0234";
 
 if ("phone" in myObject)
    document.write ("property is present");
 else
    document.write ("property is not present");
 
 // Output: property is present
