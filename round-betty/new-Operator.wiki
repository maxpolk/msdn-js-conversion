Creates a new object.

 new constructor ([ arguments ])

==Parameters==
; constructor: Required. The constructor of the object. The parentheses can be omitted if the constructor takes no arguments.
; arguments: Optional. Any arguments to be passed to the new object's constructor.

==Remarks==
The new operator performs the following tasks:

* It creates an object with no members.
* It calls the constructor for that object, passing a pointer to the newly created object as the this pointer.
* The constructor then initializes the object according to the arguments passed to the constructor.
These are examples of valid uses of the '''new''' operator.

 my_object = new Object;
 my_array = new Array();
 my_date = new Date("Jan 5 1996");
