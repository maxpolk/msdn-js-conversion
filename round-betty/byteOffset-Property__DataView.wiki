Read-only. The offset of this view from the start of its ArrayBuffer, in bytes, as fixed at construction time.

 var arrayOffset = dataView.byteOffset;

==Example==
The following example shows how to get the length of a DataView.

 var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
     req.open('GET', "http://www.example.com");
     req.responseType = "arraybuffer";
     req.send();
 
     req.onreadystatechange = function () {
         if (req.readyState === 4) {
             var buffer = req.response;
             var dataView = new DataView(buffer);
             alert(dataView.byteOffset)
         }
     }
