Right shifts the value of a variable by the number of bits specified in the value of an expression, without maintaining sign, and assigns the result to the variable.

 result '''&gt;&gt;&gt;=''' expression

==Parameters==
; result: Any variable.
; expression: Any expression.

==Remarks==
Using the &gt;&gt;&gt;= operator is exactly the same as doing the following:

 result = result &gt;&gt;&gt; expression
The '''&gt;&gt;&gt;=''' operator shifts the bits of result right by the number of bits specified in expression. Zeroes are filled in from the left. Digits shifted off the right are discarded. For example:

 var temp
 temp = -14
 temp &gt;&gt;&gt;= 2
The variable temp has an initial value of -14 (11111111 11111111 11111111 11110010 in two's complement binary). When shifted right two bits, the value equals 1073741820 (00111111 11111111 11111111 11111100 in binary).
