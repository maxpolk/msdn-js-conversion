Returns a reference to the prototype for an error.

 error.prototype
==Remarks==
The error argument is the name of an error.

Use the '''prototype''' property to provide a base set of functionality to an Error. New instances of an object "inherit" the behavior of the prototype assigned to that object.

For example, to add a method to the '''Error''' object that returns the value of the largest element of the array, declare the function, add it to '''Error.prototype''' , and then use it.

 function getSeverity(){
     if (this.number &gt; 1000)
         return "high";
     else
         return "low";
 }
 Error.prototype.getSev = getSeverity;
 var myError = new Error();
 myError.number = 5000;
 
 document.write(myError.getSev()); 
 
 // Output: high
All intrinsic JavaScript objects have a '''prototype''' property that is read-only. Properties and methods may be added to the prototype, but the object may not be assigned a different prototype. However, user-defined objects may be assigned a new prototype.
