Specifies the function that creates a date.

 date.constructor

==Remarks==
The required date is the name of a date object.

The '''constructor''' property is a member of the prototype of every object that has a prototype. The '''constructor''' property contains a reference to the function that constructs instances of that particular object.


==Example==
The following example illustrates the use of the constructor property.

 var x = new Date("Hi");
 
 if (x.constructor == Date)
     document.write("Object is a date.");
 
 // Output:
 // Object is a date.
