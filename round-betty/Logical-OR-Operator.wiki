! And <code>expression2</code> is
! The <code>result</code> is
|-

JavaScript uses the following rules for converting non-Boolean values to Boolean values:

* All objects are considered true.
* Strings are considered false if and only if they are empty.
* null and undefined are considered false.
* Numbers are false if, and only if, they are 0.
