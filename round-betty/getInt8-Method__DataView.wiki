Gets the Int8 value at the specified byte offset from the start of the view. There is no alignment constraint; multi-byte values may be fetched from any offset.

 var testInt = dataView.getInt8(byteOffset);

==Parameters==
; testInt: Required. The Int8 value that is returned from the method.
; byteOffset: The place in the buffer at which the value should be retrieved.

==Remarks==
These methods raise an exception if they would read beyond the end of the view.


==Example==
The following example shows how to get the first Int8 in the DataView.

 var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
     req.open('GET', "http://www.example.com");
     req.responseType = "arraybuffer";
     req.send();
 
     req.onreadystatechange = function () {
         if (req.readyState === 4) {
             var buffer = req.response;
             var dataView = new DataView(buffer);
             alert(dataView.getInt8(0));
         }
     }
