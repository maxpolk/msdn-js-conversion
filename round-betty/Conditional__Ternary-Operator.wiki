Returns one of two expressions depending on a condition.

 test ? expression1 : expression2
==Parameters==
; test: Any Boolean expression.
; expression1: An expression returned if test is true. May be a comma expression.
; expression2: An expression returned if test is false. More than one expression may be a linked by a comma expression.

==Remarks==
The ?: operator can be used as a shortcut for an if...else statement. It is typically used as part of a larger expression where an if...else statement would be awkward. For example:

 var now = new Date();
 var greeting = "Good" + ((now.getHours() &gt; 17) ? " evening." : " day.");
The example creates a string containing "Good evening." if it is after 6pm. The equivalent code using an if...else statement would look as follows:

 var now = new Date();
 var greeting = "Good";
 if (now.getHours() &gt; 17)
    greeting += " evening.";
 else
    greeting += " day.";
