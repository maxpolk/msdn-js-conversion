Removes elements from an array and, if necessary, inserts new elements in their place, returning the deleted elements.

 arrayObj.splice( start, deleteCount,  [ item1 [, item2 [, . . . [, itemN ]]]])

==Parameters==
; arrayObj: Required. An '''Array''' object.
; start: Required. The zero-based location in the array from which to start removing elements.
; deleteCount: Required. The number of elements to remove.
; item1, item2,. . ., itemN: Optional. Elements to insert into the array in place of the deleted elements.

==Remarks==
The '''splice''' method modifies arrayObj by removing the specified number of elements from position start and inserting new elements. The deleted elements are returned as a new '''Array''' object.


==Example==
The following code shows how to use the '''splice''' method.

 var arr = new Array("4", "11", "2", "10", "3", "1");
 arr.splice(2, 2, "21", "31");
 document.write(arr);
 
 // Output: 4,11,21,31,3,1
