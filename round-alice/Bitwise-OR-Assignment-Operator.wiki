Performs a bitwise OR on the value of a variable and the value of an expression and assigns the result to the variable.

 result '''{{!}}=''' expression

==Parameters==
; result: Any variable.
; expression: Any expression.

==Remarks==
Using this operator is exactly the same as specifying:

 result = result {{!}} expression
The '''{{!}}=''' operator looks at the binary representation of the values of result and expression and does a bitwise OR operation on them. The result of this operation behaves like this:

 0101    (result)
 1100    (expression)
 ----
 1101    (output)
Any time either of the expressions has a 1 in a digit, the result has a 1 in that digit. Otherwise, the result has a 0 in that digit.


==Requirements==
