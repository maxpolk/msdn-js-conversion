Provides support for creation of arrays of any data type.

 arrayObj = new Array() arrayObj = new Array([ size ]) arrayObj = new Array([ element0 [, element1 [, ...[, elementN ]]]])

==Parameters==
; arrayObj: Required. The variable name to which the '''Array''' object is assigned.
; size: Optional. The size of the array. As arrays are zero-based, created elements will have indexes from zero to size -1.
; element0,...,elementN: Optional. The elements to place in the array. This creates an array with n + 1 elements, and a '''length''' of n + 1. Using this syntax, you must supply more than one element.

==Remarks==
After an array is created, you can access the individual elements of the array by using [ ] notation. Note that arrays in JavaScript are zero-based.

 var my_array = new Array();
 for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
     my_array[i] = i;
 }
 x = my_array[4];
 document.write(x);
 
 // Output: 4
You can pass an unsigned 32-bit integer to the '''Array''' constructor to specify the size of the array. If the value is negative or not an integer, a run-time error occurs. If you run the following code, you should see this error in the Console.

 var arr = new Array(10);
 document.write(arr.length
 
 // Output: 10
 
 // Don't do this
 var arr = new Array(-1);
 arr = new Array(1.50);
If a single value is passed to the '''Array''' constructor, and it is not a number, the '''length''' property is set to 1, and the value of the only element becomes the single, passed-in argument.

 var arr = new Array("one");
 document.write(arr.length);
 document.write("&lt;br/&gt;");
 document.write(arr[0]);
 
 // Output:
 1
 one
JavaScript arrays are sparse arrays, which means that not all the elements in an array may contain data. In JavaScript, only the elements that actually contain data exist in the array. This reduces the amount of memory used by the array.
