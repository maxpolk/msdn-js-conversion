Executes a statement or series of statements until a specified condition is false.

 while ( expression ) { statements }

==Parameters==
; expression: Required. A Boolean expression that is checked before each iteration of the loop. If expression is true , the loop is executed. If expression is false , the loop is terminated.
; statements: Optional. One or more statements to be executed if expression is true.

==Remarks==
The while statement checks expression before a loop is first executed. If expression is false at this time, the loop is never executed.


==Example==
The following example illustrates the use of the while statement.

 var i = 0;
 var j = 10;
 while (i &lt; 100) {
     if (i == j)
         break;
     i++;
 }
 document.write(i);
 
 // Output: 10
