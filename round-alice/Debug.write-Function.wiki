Sends strings to the script debugger.

 '''Debug'''.'''write(''' [ str1  [, str2 [, ... [, strN ]]]] ''')'''

==Parameters==
; str1, str2, ... , strN: Optional. Strings to send to the script debugger.

==Remarks==
The '''Debug.write''' function sends strings to the Immediate window of a script debugger at run time. If the script is not being debugged, the '''Debug.write''' function has no effect.

The '''Debug.write''' function is almost identical to the '''Debug.writeln''' function. The only difference is that the '''Debug.writeln''' function sends a newline character after the strings are sent.


==Example==
This example uses the '''Debug.write''' function to display the value of the variable in the Immediate window of the script debugger.

'''Note''' -- To run this example, you must have a script debugger installed and the script must run in debug mode.Internet Explorer 8 includes the JavaScript debugger. If you are using an earlier version of Internet Explorer, see [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=133801 How to: Enable and Start Script Debugging from Internet Explorer].

 var counter = 42;
 Debug.write( "The value of counter is " + counter ) ;

==Requirements==
Supported in the following document modes: Quirks, Internet Explorer 6 standards, Internet Explorer 7 standards, Internet Explorer 8 standards, Internet Explorer 9 standards, Internet Explorer 10 standards. Also supported in Windows Store apps. See Version Information.
