These sections explain the elements that make up the JavaScript language.

JavaScript code in Internet Explorer can interact with HTML, CSS and the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents HTML and browser objects.

* For information about HTML, see [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251007 HTML/XHTML Reference].

* For information about the DOM, see [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251009 Document Object Model (DOM)].
JavaScript code can be used in browser applications as well as Windows Store apps. Windows Store apps are supported in Windows 8 and Visual Studio 2012.
