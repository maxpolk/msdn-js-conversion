Converts all alphabetic characters to lowercase, taking into account the host environment's current locale.

 stringVar.toLocaleLowerCase( )

==Remarks==
The required stringVar reference is a String object or string literal.

The '''toLocaleLowerCase''' method converts the characters in a string, taking into account the host environment's current locale. In most cases, the result is the same as the result of the '''toLowerCase''' method. Results differ if the rules for a language conflict with the regular Unicode case mappings.
