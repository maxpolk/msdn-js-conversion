Prevents the addition of new properties to an object.

 Object.preventExtensions( object )

==Parameters==
; object: Required. The object to make non-extensible.

==Return Value==
The object that is passed to the function.


==Exceptions==
If the object argument is not an object, a TypeError exception is thrown.


==Remarks==
The '''Object.preventExtensions''' function makes an object non-extensible, so that new named properties cannot be added to it. After an object is made non-extensible, it cannot be made extensible.

For information about how to set property attributes, see [[Objects/Object/Object.defineProperty Function|Object.defineProperty Function]].

The following related functions prevent the modification of object attributes.

{| class='wikitable'
|-
! Function
! Object is made non-extensible
! configurable is set to false for each property
! writable is set to false for each property
|-
| '''Object.preventExtensions'''
| Yes
| No
| No
|-
| [[Objects/Object/Object.seal Function|Object.seal]]
| Yes
| Yes
| No
|-
| [[Objects/Object/Object.freeze Function|Object.freeze]]
| Yes
| Yes
| Yes
|}
The following functions return true if all of the conditions marked in the following table are true.

{| class='wikitable'
|-
! Function
! Object is extensible?
! configurable is false for all properties?
! writable is false for all data properties?
|-
| [[Objects/Object/Object.isExtensible Function|Object.isExtensible]]
| Yes
| No
| No
|-
| [[Objects/Object/Object.isSealed Function|Object.isSealed]]
| No
| Yes
| No
|-
| [[Objects/Object/Object.isFrozen Function|Object.isFrozen]]
| No
| Yes
| Yes
|}

==Example==
The following example illustrates the use of the '''Object.preventExtensions''' function.

 // Create an object that has two properties.
 var obj = { pasta: "spaghetti", length: 10 };
 
 // Make the object non-extensible.
 Object.preventExtensions(obj);
 document.write(Object.isExtensible(obj));
 document.write("&lt;br/&gt;");
 
 // Try to add a new property, and then verify that it is not added.
 obj.newProp = 50;
 document.write(obj.newProp);
 
 // Output:
 // false
 // undefined
