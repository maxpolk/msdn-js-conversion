Returns a value that indicates whether new properties can be added to an object.

 Object.isExtensible( object )

==Parameters==
; object: Required. The object to test.

==Return Value==
true if the object is extensible, which indicates that new properties can be added to the object; otherwise, false.


==Exceptions==
If the object argument is not an object, a TypeError exception is thrown.


==Remarks==
For information about how to set property attributes, see [[Objects/Object/Object.defineProperty Function|Object.defineProperty Function]]. To obtain the attributes of a property, you can use the [[Objects/Object/Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor Function|Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor Function]].

The following related functions prevent the modification of object attributes.

{| class='wikitable'
|-
! Function
! Object is made non-extensible
! configurable is set to false for each property
! writable is set to false for each property
|-
| [[Objects/Object/Object.preventExtensions Function|Object.preventExtensions]]
| Yes
| No
| No
|-
| [[Objects/Object/Object.seal Function|Object.seal]]
| Yes
| Yes
| No
|-
| [[Objects/Object/Object.freeze Function|Object.freeze]]
| Yes
| Yes
| Yes
|}
The following functions return true if all of the conditions marked in the following table are true.

{| class='wikitable'
|-
! Function
! Object is extensible?
! configurable is false for all properties?
! writable is false for all data properties?
|-
| '''Object.isExtensible'''
| Yes
| No
| No
|-
| [[Objects/Object/Object.isSealed Function|Object.isSealed]]
| No
| Yes
| No
|-
| [[Objects/Object/Object.isFrozen Function|Object.isFrozen]]
| No
| Yes
| Yes
|}

==Example==
The following example illustrates the use of the '''Object.isExtensible''' function.

 // Create an object that has two properties.
 var obj = { pasta: "spaghetti", length: 10 };
 
 // Make the object non-extensible.
 Object.preventExtensions(obj);
 
 // Try to add a new property, and then verify that it is not added.
 obj.newProp = 50;
 document.write(obj.newProp);
 
 // Output:
 undefined
