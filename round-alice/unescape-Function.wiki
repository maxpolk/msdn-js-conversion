Decodes '''String''' objects encoded with the '''escape''' function. Deprecated.

 unescape( charString )

==Remarks==
The required charString argument is a '''String''' object or literal to be decoded.

The '''unescape''' function returns a string value that contains the contents of charstring. All characters encoded with the % xx hexadecimal form are replaced by their ASCII character set equivalents.

Characters encoded in '''%u''' xxxx format (Unicode characters) are replaced with the Unicode character with hexadecimal encoding xxxx.

'''Note''' -- The '''unescape''' function should not be used to decode Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI). Use '''decodeURI''' and '''decodeURIComponent''' functions instead.
