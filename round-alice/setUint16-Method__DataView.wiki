Sets the Uint16 value at the specified byte offset from the start of the view. There is no alignment constraint; multi-byte values may be set at any offset.

 dataView.setUint16(byteOffset, value, littleEndian);

==Parameters==
; testInt: Required. The Uint16 value that is returned from the method.
; value: The value to set.
; byteOffset: The place in the buffer at which the value should be retrieved.
; littleEndian: Optional. If false or undefined, a big-endian value should be written, otherwise a little-endian value should be written.

==Remarks==
These methods raise an exception if they would write beyond the end of the view.


==Example==
The following example shows how to set the first Uint16 in the DataView.

 var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
     req.open('GET', "http://www.example.com");
     req.responseType = "arraybuffer";
     req.send();
 
     req.onreadystatechange = function () {
         if (req.readyState === 4) {
             var buffer = req.response;
             var dataView = new DataView(buffer);
             dataView.setUint16(0, 9);
         }
     }
