When a Windows Runtime call returns an HRESULT that indicates a failure, JavaScript converts it to a special Windows Runtime error. It is available only in Windows Store apps, when the Windows Runtime is available, as part of the global JavaScript namespace.

 errorObj = '''new WinRTError()''' ;

==Remarks==
The WinRTError error type is used only for errors that originate in Windows Runtime APIs.


==Example==
The following example shows how a WinRTError is thrown and caught.

 try {
             Windows.Storage.KnownFolders.documentsLibrary.createFileAsync("sample.txt");
         } catch (err) {
             var n = err;
         }

==Methods==
The WinRTError object has no methods.


==Properties==
The WinRTError object has the same properties as the [[Objects/Error|Error Object]] object.


==Requirements==
The WinRTError object is supported only in Windows Store apps, not in Internet Explorer.
