Specifies the function that creates an Error.

 error.constructor

==Remarks==
The required error is the name of an error object.

The '''constructor''' property is a member of the prototype of every object that has a prototype. The '''constructor''' property contains a reference to the function that constructs instances of that particular object.


==Example==
The following example illustrates the use of the constructor property.

 var x = new Error("This is an error");
 
 if (x.constructor == Error)
     document.write("Object is an error.");
 
 // Output:
 // Object is an error.
