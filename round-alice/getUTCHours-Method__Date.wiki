Gets the hours value in a '''Date''' object using Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

 dateObj.getUTCHours()

==Parameters==
The required dateObj reference is a Date object.


==Return Value==
Returns an integer between 0 and 23 indicating the number of hours since midnight. Zero is returned if the time is before 1:00:00 am. If a '''Date''' object was created without specifying the time, by default the hour is 0 in UTC time. This time may be non-zero in other time zones.


==Remarks==
To get the number of hours elapsed since midnight using local time, use the '''getHours''' method.


==Example==
The following example illustrates the use of the '''getUTCHours''' method.

 var date = new Date("1/1/2001");
 document.write(date.getUTCHours());
 document.write("&lt;br/&gt;");
 
 var date2 = new Date("1/1/2001 11:22:33");
 document.write(datee.getUTCHours());
 
 // Output (in the PST time zone):
 // 8
 // 19
