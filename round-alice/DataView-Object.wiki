You can use a DataView object to read and write the different kinds of binary data to any location in the ArrayBuffer.

 dataView = '''new DataView(''' DataView( buffer , byteOffset , byteLength ));

==Parameters==
; dataView: Required. The variable name to which the '''DataView''' object is assigned.
; buffer: The ArrayBuffer that the DataView represents.
; byteOffset: Optional. Specifies the offset in bytes from the start of the buffer at which the DataView should begin.
; byteLength: Optional. Specifies the length (in bytes) of the section of the buffer that the DataView should represent.

==Remarks==
If both byteOffset and byteLength are omitted, the DataView spans the entire ArrayBuffer range. If the byteLength is omitted, the DataView extends from the given byteOffset until the end of the ArrayBuffer. If the given byteOffset and byteLength references an area beyond the end of the ArrayBuffer, an exception is raised.


==Properties==
The following table lists the properties of the '''DataView''' object.

{| class='wikitable'
|-
! Property
! Description
|-
| [[Objects/DataView/buffer|buffer Property]]
| Read-only. Gets the ArrayBuffer that is referenced by this view.
|-
| [[Objects/DataView/byteLength|byteLength Property]]
| Read-only. The length of this view from the start of its ArrayBuffer, in bytes, as fixed at construction time.
|-
| [[Objects/DataView/byteOffset|byteOffset Property]]
| Read-only. The offset of this view from the start of its ArrayBuffer, in bytes, as fixed at construction time.
|}

==Methods==
The following table lists the methods of the '''DataView''' object.

==Example==
The following example shows how to use a DataView object to process the binary data acquired from an XmlHttpRequest:

 var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
     req.open('GET', "http://www.example.com");
     req.responseType = "arraybuffer";
     req.send();
 
     req.onreadystatechange = function () {
         if (req.readyState === 4) {
             var buffer = req.response;
             var dataView = new DataView(buffer);
             var ints = new Int32Array(dataView.byteLength / 4);
             for (var i = 0; i &lt; ints.length; i++) {
                 ints[i] = dataview.getInt32(i * 4);
             }
         alert(ints[10]);
         }
     }
