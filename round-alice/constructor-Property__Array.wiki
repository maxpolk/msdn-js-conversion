Specifies the function that creates an array.

 array.constructor

==Remarks==
The required array is the name of an array.

The '''constructor''' property is a member of the prototype of every object that has a prototype. This includes all intrinsic JavaScript objects except the '''Global''' and '''Math''' objects. The '''constructor''' property contains a reference to the function that constructs instances of that particular object.


==Example==
The following example illustrates the use of the constructor property.

 var x = new Array();
 
 if (x.constructor == Array)
     document.write("Object is an Array.");
 else
     document.write("Object is not an Array.");
 
 // Output:
 // Object is an Array.
