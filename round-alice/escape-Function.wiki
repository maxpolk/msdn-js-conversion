Encodes strings so they can be read on all computers. Deprecated.

 escape( charString ''')'''

==Remarks==
The required charString argument is any '''String''' object or literal to be encoded.

The '''escape''' function returns a string value (in Unicode format) that contains the contents of charstring. All spaces, punctuation, accented characters, and any other non-ASCII characters are replaced with % xx encoding, where xx is equivalent to the hexadecimal number representing the character. For example, a space is returned as "%20."

Characters with a value greater than 255 are stored using the '''%u''' xxxx format.

'''Note''' -- The '''escape''' function should not be used to encode Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI). Use '''encodeURI''' and '''encodeURIComponent''' functions instead.

'''Applies To''' : [[javascript/Global|Global Object]]
