Provides functionality common to all JavaScript objects.

 obj '''= new Object(''' [ value ] ''')'''

==Parameters==
; obj: Required. The variable name to which the Object object is assigned.
; value: Optional. Any one of the JavaScript primitive data types (Number, Boolean, or String). If value is an object, the object is returned unmodified. If value is null , '''undefined''' , or not supplied, an object with no content is created.

==Remarks==
The Object object is contained in all other JavaScript objects; all of its methods and properties are available in all other objects. The methods can be redefined in user-defined objects, and are called by JavaScript at appropriate times. The '''toString''' method is an example of a frequently redefined Object method.

In this language reference, the description of each Object method includes both default and object-specific implementation information for the intrinsic JavaScript objects.
