Left shifts the bits of an expression.

 result '''=''' expression1 '''&lt;&lt;''' expression2

==Parameters==
; result: Any variable.
; expression1: Any expression.
; expression2: Any expression.

==Remarks==
The '''&lt;&lt;''' operator shifts the bits of expression1 left by the number of bits specified in expression2. For example:

 var temp
 temp = 14 &lt;&lt; 2
The variable temp has a value of 56 because 14 (00001110 in binary) shifted left two bits equals 56 (00111000 in binary).
