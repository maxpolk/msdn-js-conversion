Performs a bitwise OR on two expressions.

 result '''=''' expression1 '''{{!}}''' expression2

==Parameters==
; result: Any variable.
; expression1: Any expression.
; expression2: Any expression.

==Remarks==
The '''{{!}}''' operator looks at the binary representation of the values of two expressions and does a bitwise OR operation on them. The result of this operation behaves as follows:

 0101   (expression1)
 1100   (expression2)
 ----
 1101   (result)
Any time either of the expressions has a 1 in a digit, the result will have a 1 in that digit. Otherwise, the result will have a 0 in that digit.
