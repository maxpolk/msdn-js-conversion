Removes the last element from an array and returns it.

 arrayObj.pop( )

==Remarks==
The [[Objects/Array/push|push]] and '''pop''' methods enable you to simulate a stack, which uses the principle of last in, first out (LIFO) to store data.

The required arrayObj reference is an '''Array''' object.

If the array is empty, undefined is returned.


==Example==
The following example illustrates the use of the pop method.

 var number;
 var my_array = new Array();
 
 my_array.push (5, 6, 7);
 my_array.push (8, 9);
 
 number = my_array.pop();
 while (number != undefined)
    {
    document.write (number + " ");
    number = my_array.pop();
    }
 
 // Output: 9 8 7 6 5
