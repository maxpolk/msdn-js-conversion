Specifies the function that creates a string.

 string.constructor

==Remarks==
The required string is the name of a string.

The '''constructor''' property is a member of the prototype of every object that has a prototype. This includes all intrinsic JavaScript objects except the '''Global''' and '''Math''' objects. The '''constructor''' property contains a reference to the function that constructs instances of that particular object.


==Example==
The following example illustrates the use of the constructor property.

 var x = new String();
 
 if (x.constructor == String)
     document.write("Object is a String.");
 else
     document.write("Object is not a String.");
 
 // Output:
 // Object is a String.
