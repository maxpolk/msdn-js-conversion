Returns the name of an error.

 errorObj.'''name'''

==Parameters==
; errorObj: Required. Instance of Error object.

==Remarks==
The '''name''' property returns the name or exception type of an error. When a runtime error occurs, the name property is set to one of the following native exception types:

{| class='wikitable'
|-
! Exception Type
! Meaning
|-
| ConversionError
| This error occurs whenever there is an attempt to convert an object into something to which it cannot be converted.
|-
| RangeError
| This error occurs when a function is supplied with an argument that has exceeded its allowable range. For example, this error occurs if you attempt to construct an '''Array''' object with a length that is not a valid positive integer.
|-
| ReferenceError
| This error occurs when an invalid reference has been detected. This error will occur, for example, if an expected reference is null.
|-
| RegExpError
| This error occurs when a compilation error occurs with a regular expression. Once the regular expression is compiled, however, this error cannot occur. This example will occur, for example, when a regular expression is declared with a pattern that has an invalid syntax, or flags other than '''i''' , '''g''' , or '''m''' , or if it contains the same flag more than once.
|-
| SyntaxError
| This error occurs when source text is parsed and that source text does not follow correct syntax. This error will occur, for example, if the '''eval''' function is called with an argument that is not valid program text.
|-
| TypeError
| This error occurs whenever the actual type of an operand does not match the expected type. An example of when this error occurs is a function call made on something that is not an object or does not support the call.
|-
| URIError
| This error occurs when an illegal Uniform Resource Indicator (URI) is detected. For example, this is error occurs when an illegal character is found in a string being encoded or decoded.
|}

==Example==
The following example causes a TypeError exception to be thrown and displays the name of the error and its message.

 try
 {
     var x = y;
 }
 catch(e)
 {
     document.write ("Error Message: " + e.message);
     document.write ("&lt;br /&gt;");
     document.write ("Error Code: ");
     document.write (e.number &amp; 0xFFFF)
     document.write ("&lt;br /&gt;");
     document.write ("Error Name: " + e.name);
 }
The output of this code is as follows.

 Error Message: 'y' is undefined
 Error Code: 5009
 Error Name: TypeError
