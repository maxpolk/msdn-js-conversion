Suspends execution.

 debugger

==Remarks==
You can place debugger statements anywhere in procedures to suspend execution. Using the debugger statement is similar to setting a breakpoint in the code.

The debugger statement suspends execution, but it does not close any files or clear any variables.

'''Note''' -- The debugger statement has no effect unless the script is being debugged.


==Example==
This example uses the debugger statement to suspend execution for each iteration through the for loop.

'''Note''' -- To run this example, you must have a script debugger installed and the script must run in debug mode.Internet Explorer 8 includes the JavaScript debugger. If you are using an earlier version of Internet Explorer, see [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=133801 How to: Enable and Start Script Debugging from Internet Explorer].

 for(i = 1; i&lt;5; i++) {
    // Print i to the Output window.
    Debug.write("loop index is " + i);
    // Wait for user to resume.
    debugger
 }
