Determines whether any try-catch blocks in this scope are to be treated by the debugger as user-unhandled. Exceptions can be classified as thrown, user-unhandled or unhandled.

If this property is set to true in a given scope, the debugger can then determine to take some action (for example, break) on exceptions thrown inside that scope if the developer wishes to break on user-unhandled exceptions. If this property is set to false is the same as if the property was never set.

For more information on debugging, see [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=249469 Active Script Debugging Overview].

     } catch (e) {
     // Catch the exception.
