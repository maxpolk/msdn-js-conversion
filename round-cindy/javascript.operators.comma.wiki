Causes two expressions to be executed sequentially.

 expression1 , expression2
==Parameters==
; expression1: Any expression.
; expression2: Any expression.

==Remarks==
The ''',''' operator causes the expressions to be executed in left-to-right order. A common use for the ''',''' operator is in the increment expression of a '''for''' loop. For example:

 j=25;
 for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++, j++)
 {
    k = i + j;
 }
The '''for''' statement allows only a single expression to be executed at the end of every pass through a loop. The ''',''' operator allows multiple expressions to be treated as a single expression, so both variables can be incremented.
