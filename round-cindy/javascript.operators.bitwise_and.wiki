Performs a bitwise AND operation on two 32-bit expressions.

 result = expression1 &amp; expression2
==Parameters==
; result: The result of the operation.
; expression1: Any expression.
; expression2: Any expression.

==Remarks==
The &amp; does a bitwise AND operation on the each of the bits of two 32-bit expressions. If both of the bits are 1, the result is 1. Otherwise, the result is 0.

The following examples show how to use the &amp; operator.

 // 9 is 00000000000000000000000000001001
 var expr1 = 9;
 
 // 5 is 00000000000000000000000000000101
 var expr2 = 5;
 
 // 1 is 00000000000000000000000000000001
 var result = expr1 &amp; expr2;
 
 document.write(result);
 // Output: 1
