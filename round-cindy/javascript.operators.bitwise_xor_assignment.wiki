Performs a bitwise exclusive OR on a variable and an expression and assigns the result to the variable.

 result ^= expression
==Parameters==
; result: Any variable.
; expression: Any expression.

==Remarks==
Using the '''^=''' operator is exactly the same as specifying:

 result = result ^ expression
The '''^=''' operator looks at the binary representation of the values of two expressions and does a bitwise exclusive OR operation on them. The result of this operation behaves as follows:

 0101    (result)
 1100    (expression)
 ----
 1001    (result)
When one, and only one, of the expressions has a 1 in a digit, the result has a 1 in that digit. Otherwise, the result has a 0 in that digit.
