Returns a pseudorandom number between 0 and 1.

 '''Math.random( ) '''
==Remarks==
The pseudorandom number generated is from 0 (inclusive) to 1 (exclusive), that is, the returned number can be zero, but it will always be less than one. The random number generator is seeded automatically when JavaScript is first loaded.
