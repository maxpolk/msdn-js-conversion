The '''toTimeString''' method returns a string value containing the time in the current time zone.


==Example==
In the following example, the time is set to 2000 milliseconds after midnight January 1, 1970 UTC, and then it is written out.

 var aDate = new Date();
      aDate.setTime(2000);
      document.write(aDate.toTimeString());
 
 // Output depends on the time in the current time zone.
