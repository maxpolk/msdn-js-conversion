Specifies the function that creates an object.

 object.constructor
==Remarks==
The required object is the name of an object or function.

The '''constructor''' property is a member of the prototype of every object that has a prototype. This includes all intrinsic JavaScript objects except the '''Global''' and '''Math''' objects. The '''constructor''' property contains a reference to the function that constructs instances of that particular object.


==Example==
The following example illustrates the use of the constructor property.

 // A constructor function.
 function MyObj() {
     this.number = 1;
 }
 
 var x = new String("Hi");
 
 if (x.constructor == String)
     document.write("Object is a String.");
 document.write ("&lt;br /&gt;");
 
 var y = new MyObj;
 if (y.constructor == MyObj)
     document.write("Object constructor is MyObj.");
 
 // Output:
 // Object is a String.
 // Object constructor is MyObj.
