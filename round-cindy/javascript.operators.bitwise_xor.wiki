Performs a bitwise exclusive OR on two expressions.

 result '''=''' expression1 '''^''' expression2
==Parameters==
; result: Any variable.
; expression1: Any expression.
; expression2: Any expression.

==Remarks==
The '''^''' operator looks at the binary representation of the values of two expressions and does a bitwise exclusive OR operation on them. The result of this operation behaves as follows:

 0101   (expression1)
 1100   (expression2)
 ----
 1001   (result)
When one, and only one, of the expressions has a 1 in a digit, the result has a 1 in that digit. Otherwise, the result has a 0 in that digit.
