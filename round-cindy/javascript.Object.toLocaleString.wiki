Returns a date converted to a string using the current locale.

 dateObj.'''toLocaleString()''' 
==Remarks==
The required dateObj is any Date object.

The '''toLocaleString''' method returns a String object that contains the date written in the current locale's long default format.

* For dates between 1601 and 1999 A.D., the date is formatted according to the user's Control Panel Regional Settings.
* For dates outside this range, the default format of the '''toString''' method is used.
For example, in the United States, '''toLocaleString''' returns "01/05/96 00:00:00" for January 5. In Europe, it returns "05/01/96 00:00:00" for the same date, as European convention puts the day before the month.

'''Note''' -- '''toLocaleString''' should only be used to display results to a user; it should never be used as the basis for computation within a script as the returned result is machine-specific.


==Example==
The following example illustrates the use of the '''toLocaleString''' method.

 function toLocaleStrDemo(){   
    var d, s;                      //Declare variables.
    d = new Date();                //Create Date object.
    s = "Current setting is ";
    s += d.toLocaleString() ;       //Convert to current locale.
    return(s);                     //Return converted date
 }
