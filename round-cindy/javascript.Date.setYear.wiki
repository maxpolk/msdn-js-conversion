Sets the year value in the Date object.

 dateObj.'''setYear(''' numYear ''')''' 
==Parameters==
; dateObj: Required. Any Date object.
; numYear: Required. For the years 1900 through 1999, this is a numeric value equal to the year minus 1900. For dates outside that range, this is a 4-digit numeric value.

==Remarks==
This method is obsolete, and is maintained for backwards compatibility only. Use the '''setFullYear''' method instead.

To set the year of a Date object to 1997, call '''setYear(97)'''. To set the year to 2010, call '''setYear(2010)'''. Finally, to set the year to a year in the range 0-99, use the '''setFullYear''' method.

'''Note''' -- For JavaScript version 1.0, '''setYear''' uses a value that is the result of the addition of 1900 to the year value provided by numYear , regardless of the value of the year. For example, to set the year to 1899 numYear is -1 and to set the year 2000 numYear is 100.
