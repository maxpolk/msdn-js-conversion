Gets or sets the stack trace limit, which is equivalent to the number of error frames to display. The default limit is 10.

 Error '''.stackTraceLimit''' 
==Remarks==
You can set the '''stackTraceLimit''' property to any positive value between 0 and Infinity. If the '''stackTraceLimit''' property is set to 0 at the time an error is thrown, no stack trace is shown. If the property is set to a negative value or a non-numeric value, the value is converted to 0. If the stackTraceLimit is set to Infinity , the entire stack is shown. Otherwise, ToUint32 is used to convert the value.


==Example==
The following example shows how to set and then get the stack trace limit.

 try
     {
     var err = new Error("my error");
     Error.stackTraceLimit = 7;
     throw err;
     }
 catch(e)
     {
     document.write ("Error stack trace limit: ")
     document.write (Error.stackTraceLimit);
     }
