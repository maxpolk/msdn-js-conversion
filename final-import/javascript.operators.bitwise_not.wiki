{{Remarks_Section
|Remarks=All unary operators, such as the ~ operator, evaluate expressions as follows:

* If applied to undefined or null expressions, a run-time error is raised.
* Objects are converted to strings.
* Strings are converted to numbers if possible. If not, a run-time error is raised.
* Boolean values are treated as numbers (0 if false, 1 if true).
The operator is applied to the resulting number.

The ~ operator looks at the binary representation of the values of the expression and does a bitwise negation operation on it.

Any digit that is a 1 in the expression becomes a 0 in the result. Any digit that is a 0 in the expression becomes a 1 in the result.

The following example illustrates use of the bitwise NOT (~) operator.

 var temp = ~5;
The resulting value is -6, as shown in the following table.
