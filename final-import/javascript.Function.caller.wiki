{{Remarks_Section
|Remarks=The functionName object is the name of any executing function.

The '''caller''' property is defined for a function only while that function is executing. If the function is called from the top level of a JavaScript program, '''caller''' contains null.

If the '''caller''' property is used in a string context, the result is the same as functionName.'''toString''' , that is, the decompiled text of the function is displayed.

The following example illustrates the use of the '''caller''' property:

 function CallLevel(){
    if ( CallLevel.caller == null)
       return("CallLevel was called from the top level.");
    else
       return("CallLevel was called by another function.");
 }
 
 document.write(CallLevel());
 
 // Output: CallLevel was called from the top level.
