{{Remarks_Section
|Remarks=Using this operator is the same as specifying:

 result = result &amp; expression
The [[javascript/operators/bitwise and{{!}}Bitwise AND Operator (&amp;)]] looks at the binary representation of the values of result and expression and does a bitwise AND operation on them. The output of this operation behaves like this:

 // 9 is 00000000000000000000000000001001
 var expr1 = 9;
 
 // 5 is 00000000000000000000000000000101
 var expr2 = 5;
  
 
 // 1 is 00000000000000000000000000000001
 expr1 &amp;= expr2;
 
 document.write(expr1);
Any time both of the expressions have a 1 in a digit, the result has a 1 in that digit. Otherwise, the result has a 0 in that digit.
